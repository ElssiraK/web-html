  <h3><p >I am Elssira Kabashi - The Future Programmer!</h3></p>
  <h4><p>Education illuminates our future and guides us in the right direction so I think it is important for a person to shape his way of life.
I chose Computer Science because Technology nowadays is the future, I like working with computer and creative software.
While I was in high school I was given the opportunity to attend some training for the education of small programs such as HTML and I was very excited so I was very encouraged to learn computer language.</br>
    <br>Also the salary for a programmer is very high, we gain a very lucrative career.
There are many reasons why I chose Computer Science. Technology today is the way of the future. I ask people to continue learning more about Technology. It is not so easy this branch I have chosen, but I hope and I am confident in myself that I have to finish with a lot of success and great achievements.</p></h4>
